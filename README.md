# OneRoute
### In this project I performed all the crud operations using node,express,react, and mongo by creating the api's for that.
### This project helped to understand the proper structure of a web app and the most important the structure of the web app.
### In this project I have used static rendering and did not used server side rendering .
### For the frontend I used react project then converted that in to a static page by using ## npm run build ,which convert the react app into plane html,css, and js file(build folder).
### then I merged the backend with frontend so that i can see my frontend and backend at one server. In this process routing of the pages was very challenging
